# Playlist reporting application - [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/) associated project

The subject of my project is to create a song reporting tool for a radio station. Radio stations are obliged to report the music they play to the music copyright holder organizations. The users of the application are the dj's and the employees of the station. The dj's report all the songs they play in their shows. The employees of the station make sure all the shows have been reported, and then forward all the reports to the copyright holder organizations in the [required format](https://www.gramex.fi//wp-content/uploads/2018/11/raportointiohje_kaupalliset_radiot_1_7_20091.pdf) on a monthly basis.

The app is deployed [here](https://teostoraportointi.herokuapp.com/)
